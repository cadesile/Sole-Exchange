    <p>Taxonomy Token provides the following tokens for taxonomies set as 
      "single bottom term" on the settings page:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>[node:vocab:TID:bottomterm]</dt>
        <dd>Bottom term name in vocabulary with id = TID.</dd>
      <dt>[node:vocab:TID:bottomterm:url]</dt>
        <dd>Bottom term name in vocabulary with id = TID modified to be used in
          URLs and paths (Pathauto for example).</dd>
      <dt>[node:vocab:TID:bottomterm-raw]</dt>
        <dd>Unfiltered name of bottom term in vocabulary with id = TID. WARNING - 
          raw user input.</dd>
      <dt>[node:vocab:TID:bottomterm-id]</dt>
        <dd>ID of bottom term in vocabulary with id = TID.</dd>
      <dt>[node:vocab:TID:bottomtermalias]</dt>
        <dd>URL alias for the bottom term.</dd>
    <p>Taxonomy Token provides the following tokens for taxonomies set as
      "single top term" on the settings page:</p>
      <dt>[node:vocab:TID:term]</dt>
        <dd>Top term name in vocabulary with id = TID.</dd>
      <dt>[node:vocab:TID:term:url]</dt>
        <dd>Top term name in vocabulary with id = TID modified to be used in
          URLs and paths (Pathauto for example).</dd>
      <dt>[node:vocab:TID:term-raw]</dt>
        <dd>Unfiltered name of top term in vocabulary with id = TID. WARNING - 
          raw user input.</dd>
      <dt>[node:vocab:TID:term-id]</dt>
        <dd>ID of top term in vocabulary with id = TID.</dd>
      <dt>[node:vocab:TID:termalias]</dt>
        <dd>URL alias for the top term.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      For taxonomies set as "single and complete path" in the settings page the
      following tokens are <strong>also</strong> created:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>[node:vocab:TID:termpath]</dt>
        <dd>As [node:vocab:TID:term] above but including its supercategories
          separated by /.</dd>
      <dt>[node:vocab:TID:termpath:url]</dt>
        <dd>As [node:vocab:TID:term:url] above but including its supercategories
          separated by /.</dd>
      <dt>[node:vocab:TID:termpath-raw]</dt>
        <dd>As [node:vocab:TID:term-raw] above but including its supercategories
          separated by /. WARNING - raw user input.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The taxonomy id (TID) is used to identify each taxonomy instead of some
      simplified version of the taxonomy name as the first is invariant and the
      former can be edited at any time. If the taxonomy name was used to 
      identify taxonomy tokens any change in the taxonomy name would require
      also editing of all taxonomy tokens already in use.</p>
